# EXTRA CREDIT

1) In this I did do the extra credit, on the email section I did put in more elaborate error messages for when the user doesn't have anything in the input and if they fail the regex.

2) Did disable conflicting time when selecting other activities.

3) I did also add real time error messages on the email input to give real-time feedback.
